* Neighborhood
* Scholarship, Hypertension, Diabetes, Alcoholism (and other health conditions)
* Received SMS notification
* No-show status ("No-show": "Yes" indicates the patient *did not* show up)

## Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel:** Used for data manipulation and cleaning.

## Deliverables

* A cleaned version of the medical appointment no-shows dataset.
* This `README.md` file summarizing the cleaning process.

1.  **Load the Data:**

    * Opened the CSV file in Microsoft Excel.

2.  **Inspect the Data:**

    * Examined the first few rows and column types in Excel to get an initial overview of the data.

3.  **Handle Missing Values:**

## Summary of Changes

(Provide a concise summary of the key changes made to the dataset. For example:)

* Handled missing values in the Age column using the median.
* Standardized date formats for appointment and scheduled dates.
* Corrected inconsistent gender values.
* Removed duplicate records.
