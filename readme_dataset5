## 🧹 Cleaning Steps Performed in Excel

1. **Removed Duplicate Records** using Excel’s **Remove Duplicates** feature.
2. **Handled Missing Values**:
   - Identified empty cells using filters.
   - Filled or removed missing data based on importance (e.g., kept important fields like `Sales`, `Order Date`, `Customer Name` complete).
3. **Converted Date Columns** (e.g., `Order Date`) to consistent format: `dd-mm-yyyy`.
4. **Standardized Text Columns**:
   - Uniform casing in `City`, `State`, `Country`, and `Product Line`
   - Trimmed extra spaces using `=TRIM()` function
5. **Formatted Numeric Columns**:
   - Ensured `Sales`, `Price Each`, and `MSRP` were in number format.
   - Checked that `Quantity Ordered` and `Order Line Number` were integers.
6. **Cleaned Column Headers**:
   - Used consistent, lowercase, snake_case (e.g., `order_number`, `quantity_ordered`, `price_each`)
7. **Saved Cleaned File** as `sales_data_cleaned.xlsx`
